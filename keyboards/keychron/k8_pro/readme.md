## Option A: Build And Flash Firmware

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make keychron/k8_pro/ansi/rgb:keychron
    make keychron/k8_pro/ansi/white:keychron
    make keychron/k8_pro/iso/rgb:keychron
    make keychron/k8_pro/iso/white:keychron
    make keychron/k8_pro/jis/rgb:keychron
    make keychron/k8_pro/jis/white:keychron

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make keychron/k8_pro/ansi/rgb:keychron:flash
    make keychron/k8_pro/ansi/white:keychron:flash
    make keychron/k8_pro/iso/rgb:keychron:flash
    make keychron/k8_pro/iso/white:keychron:flash
    make keychron/k8_pro/jis/rgb:keychron:flash
    make keychron/k8_pro/jis/white:keychron:flash

**Reset Key**: Connect the USB cable, toggle mode switch to "Off", hold down the *Esc* key or reset button underneath space bar, then toggle then switch to "Cable".

### OpenRGB support (ansi/rgb)

The `openrgb` keymap on `ansi/rgb` supports both [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org) and VIA.

**Important Usage Notes:**
- Switch between OpenRGB and VIA mode with `Fn + O` (Windows layer only).
- **OpenRGB mode is enabled by default.** Turn it off (`Fn + O`) before configuring lighting in VIA for the first time.
- While OpenRGB mode is enabled, the VIA lighting configuration in the browser will not work.
- To use VIA again, disable OpenRGB mode with `Fn + O`.

A pre-built `ansi/rgb:openrgb` firmware is available in `firmware/`.

## Option B: Use Keychron Launcher (no code required)

If you just want to remap keys, configure layers, or change lighting, you don't need to build firmware:

1. Open [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/) in a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, or Vivaldi
2. Connect your Keychron keyboard via USB
3. Remap keys, configure layers, and adjust lighting - changes apply instantly

Keychron Launcher works out of the box with no JSON import required, providing a simpler browser-based setup flow for supported boards. Safari and other non-Chromium browsers will not work with Keychron Launcher.
